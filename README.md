# MFG598 Final Project – Dawson Rockers

Welcome to the final project repository for MFG598, created by Dawson Rockers, a Robotics Engineering student at Arizona State University.
This repository contains the modeling, simulation, and analysis files for a custom-designed mechanical assembly, developed as part of the course's culminating project.
## 🔧 Project Overview

The focus of this project is to visualize data through plotting, applying theoretical knowledge from MFG598 in a practical coding scenario. The script showcases proficiency in:

    Data visualization using Python

    Utilizing matplotlib for plotting

    Understanding of data representation in engineering contexts
    
## 📁 Repository Contents

    /FinalCode.py/ – The main Python script that generates the plot.

    /README.md/ – This file.
    
## 📌 Key Features

    Interactive AQI Data Exploration: Select U.S. states and counties to visualize Air Quality Index (AQI) data across a 25-year period.

    Dynamic Filtering: Use sliders to define custom year ranges and explore location-specific air quality trends.

    Dual-Level Analysis: View AQI trends and statistics at both county and state levels.

    Data Visualizations: Generate interactive time-series plots using Plotly to illustrate AQI trends.

    Predictive Modeling: Forecast future AQI values using linear regression based on historical data.

    Streamlit Web App Interface: User-friendly UI with dropdowns, sliders, checkboxes, and embedded dataframes.
